# An Empirical Alternative to the AI-2027 Takeoff Timelines
*Andreas Robinson - 10/06/2025*

**TL;DR:** The AI-2027 recursive self-improvement takeoff-timeline depends heavily on the authors’ intuitive projections of human-only research progress, whereas this post develops a more empirically-grounded model of research-progress based on past trends, which suggests that AI-2027 could be substantially underestimating the likely timeline for AI recursive-takeoff (initiated by coding AIs), as well as underestimating the extent to which such a takeoff may be bottlenecked by compute. I also argue that there are intrinsic benefits to shifting in the direction of a more trend-based empirical approach to making these projections. Note that AI-2027’s takeoff report is distinct from their timeline report, which was focused on the timeline leading up to the take-off phase and has already been widely critiqued elsewhere.
